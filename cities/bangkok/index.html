And of course, the rest of Asia is highly accessible from Bangkok&rsquo;s international Suvarnabhumi Airport.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s the city for digital nomads that like things a bit more premium, a bit more upscale, and a bit more bustling. Enjoy beautiful Bangok :)</p> <h2>Connect</h2> <h3>SIM Cards with mobile data</h3> <p>You can buy a pre-paid SIM card with data from any 7-11 in Thailand, without registration or paperwork. It’s easy, cheap, and usually the staff will activate the card for you and set it to English. Or pick up a free SIM for travelers in the airport. If you’ll be staying a while, upgrade to a data package for a faster connection and smaller fee by taking your phone (and your SIM, if you bought one at 7-11) to your provider’s kiosk at any major mall.</p> <p>Check out <a href="http://thaiprepaidcard.com/3g-data-plans-for-12call-dtac-and-true/">this</a> detailed breakdown of voice and data packages from True, Dtac, and AIS.</p> <p>TrueMove’s data and WiFi coverage is the most expansive, particularly outside of cities (this might not seem important now, but wait until you’re on an overnight bus). If you want to use TrueMove, skip the 7-11 and buy a 4G SIM directly from their shop at a mall - it can be a hassle to upgrade later.</p> <h3>Fast and Reliable WiFi</h3> <p>WiFi in Bangkok is generally fast, though it can get bogged down in periods of high demand. Coworking spaces and coffee shops know customers depend on their WiFi, so they are a solid choice.</p> <p>If you work at home, run a speed test at any apartment or hotel you’re considering, but remember that it might be much faster during the day than at night.</p> <p>Another option is to subscribe to one or several WiFi plans. TrueWiFi and DTAC are your best choices in Bangkok, for just ฿99 monthly.</p> <h3>How to meet other digital nomads</h3> <p>You’ll meet other digital nomads at coworking spaces, coffee shops, or out at bars and restaurants. Reach out to people on Facebook groups like Bangkok Digital Nomads, BarCamp and Couchsurfing. Thong Lor is Bangkok’s nomad hub, and opportunities for casual meetings abound.</p> <p>Nomad List organizes regular meetups, see <a href="http://nomadlist.com/meetups"></a><a href="http://nomadlist.com/meetups">http://nomadlist.com/meetups</a>.</p> <p>There’s a dedicated #bangkok channel with 100+ people to chat to on the digital nomad chat community <a href="http://hashtagnomads.com"></a><a href="http://hashtagnomads.com">http://hashtagnomads.com</a>.</p> <h2>Live</h2> <h3>Where should you live?</h3> <p>Living close to the Skytrain or the MRT is crucial for a pleasant short-term stay in Bangkok, and the extra rent is worth the convenience and peace of mind.</p> <p>To settle quickly, get connected, and get to work, the easiest areas are Thong Lo and Ekamai, upscale neighborhoods on the Skytrain’s Sukhumvit line, filled with trendy restaurants, clubs, and a variety of coworking spaces. Soi 38, across Sukhumvit from Thong Lo, is full of street food. Another stop down, Pra Khanong and On Nut are convenient and a little cheaper.</p> <p>Bangkok is enormous, with options for nearly any kind of housing and lifestyle. To make it easy for you to get started quickly, this guide recommends places on the Sukhumvit line as much as possible – but this doesn’t scratch the surface of what you’ll find when you explore the rest of Bangkok.</p> <p>Many new arrivals will start out on Khaosan Road in Bang Lamphu, near the Royal Palace and packed with guesthouses, travel agencies, and tourists. While it’s a nightlife hub and a great spot for international food, the bad transportation and lack of work space make it less than ideal for long-term stays.</p> <p>To crash right after you arrive but avoid Khaosan Road, GLUR Hostel (45 Charoen Krung 50 Alley, Bang Rak, Bangkok 10500) and Oldtown Hostel  (<a href="http://oldtownhostelbkk.com/"></a>)<a href="http://oldtownhostelbkk.com/">http://oldtownhostelbkk.com/</a> (1058 Charon Krung, Maha Phruttharam, Bang Rak, Bangkok 10500) are well-reviewed by nomads. Wifi is reliable and fast at Oldtown, while GLUR has a 24-hour workspace.</p> <h3>Finding an apartment</h3> <p>The best time to find an apartment is after you arrive. Pick a neighborhood you like and walk around looking for signs (in English or Thai), then call the phone number or knock on the door. Your landlord might not speak English, so either ask a Thai friend for help or be apologetic and polite while the landlord finds someone who can talk to you. You can also enlist a Thai real estate agent, which might mean you pay a little more, but have access to apartments you’d never find otherwise.</p> <p>Some other resources: Hipflat (<a href="http://www.hipflat.co.th/"></a>)<a href="http://www.hipflat.co.th/">http://www.hipflat.co.th/</a> and the facebook groups Desperately Seeking Bangkok and Bangkok-Take Over My Lease .</p> <p>A deposit of 1-2 months’ rent is normal, but try to get the terms of the deposit in writing. Expect to lose a portion of it for cleaning or other issues. Renting month-to-month is more expensive than a long-term lease, but many places will let you take a 3 or 6 month contract, then go month-to-month at the same rate.</p> <p>Most apartments will have basic furniture (bed, dresser, table, and television), but if it’s unfurnished you will pay significantly less. A lot of buildings that look like apartment complexes are actually condos, so units can vary a huge amount in price and quality within the same building. Be sure to check out the neighborhood at night in case a loud karaoke bar opens up next door – they can be invisible during the day.</p> <p>Foreigners aren’t usually gouged for rent, but they’ll usually end up paying more because they need things like a/c, a kitchen sink, or to be close to public transportation. Know what similar apartments in the same neighborhood cost, and negotiate politely if you think a modest discount is fair. If you think a landlord is trying to rip you off at the beginning, just don’t rent from them – this isn’t normal in Thailand, and they’ll end up making your life difficult in some other way while you live there.</p> <h3>Getting around</h3> <p>The <a href="http://www.bangkok.com/bts/">BTS Skytrain</a> and <a href="http://www.bangkok.com/information-travel-around/mrt.htm">MRT</a> subway system will take you nearly anywhere you need to go, quickly and in A/C.  Expect to take the Skytrain or MRT most of the time, then hop into a cab or on a motorcycle taxi to complete your trip. Trains run from 6am-midnight, and fares start from ฿15 for one stop, up to ฿120 for a day pass. Refillable <a href="http://www.bangkok.com/information-travel-around/bts.htm">Rabbit Cards and 30-day passes</a> are also available.</p> <p>Taxis are the next best option. The flag falls at ฿35 and each km is ~฿6 – insist on the meter. For several people travelling together, taxis are often cheaper than public transport, but they can get caught in traffic. Most taxi drivers speak at least some English (and some are amazing sources for local info), but don’t count on it - try to have your destination written down in Thai.  If you’re traveling by highway, you’ll pay the plus any road tolls. Tipping is appreciated.</p> <p>Uber is also available in Bangkok.</p> <p>Local motorcycle taxis can bridge the gap between public transport and your actual destination, but they are fast, unpredictable, and not the safest option after dark. Hail a motorcycle taxi from a stand, indicated by guys with motorcycles and orange vests, a sign with Thai writing and (usually) the letters BTS. The prices to typical destinations (like the local BTS station) will be posted on these signs in Thai, or just hand the driver a 50 or 100 baht note and wait for change. Most nomads won’t want to drive a motorcycle or bicycle, since Bangkok is huge and traffic is harrowing.</p> <p>Ferry boats are cheap, fast, and the best way to get around near the Chao Phraya - particularly in Bang Lamphu, which is inaccessible by Skytrain and MRT. Hop onto an Orange Flag boat at sunset for an unbeatable view, for around ฿15.</p> <p>City buses are cheap, but generally inconvenient and time-consuming. The bus up Thonglor is easier than catching a taxi around rush hour, though.</p> <p>Tuk tuks aren’t a great choice in Bangkok and are usually just for tourists. If you must, negotiate the price ahead of time and pay after your trip.</p> <h3>Current prices</h3> <p>Housing: A modern, Western-style apartment with A/C , in a secure building with amenities and near the BTS (especially in Thonglor) could be anywhere from ฿15,000-30,000++</p> <p>Meals: ฿40-60 on the street, ฿100 for a Thai meal in a mid-range restaurant, ฿150++ for Western or international food in a restaurant.</p> <p>Drinks: ฿5-20 for a bottle of water, ฿20-40 for a fruit shake on the street, ฿40-60 for a cup of coffee in a café.</p> <p>Alcohol: The large bottle of Thai beer that costs ฿40 at the 7-11 will run ฿100++ at a bar. Cocktails are ฿100++, and import liquor is more.</p> <p>Groceries from a supermarket: ฿60 for a loaf of bread, ฿100 for a quart of milk, ฿60-80 for a package of salad greens, ฿2-300+ for 100g of cheese. Shopping at the local market for veggies, fruit, and meat will save a bundle.</p> <p>Data SIM card starter pack: ฿50-200 depending on provider and data/talk tim, and around ~฿500+ for monthly data.</p> <h3>Medical emergencies</h3> <p>For a cold, upset stomach, or other common ailments, go to a pharmacy (look for a green cross and English-language signs). Pharmacists err on the strong side, so Google any medications (esp. antibiotics) before you take them.</p> <p>Major hospitals in Bangkok will provide a standard of care similar to or better than what you would find at home and will have some English-speaking staff. Bangkok has some of the world’s best international hospitals, like Samitivej Sukhumvit (<a href="http://www.samitivejhospitals.com/hospital-services/hospital-locations/samitivej-sukhumvit/">http://www.samitivejhospitals.com/hospital-services/hospital-locations/samitivej-sukhumvit/</a>) (133 Sukhumvit 49, Klongtan Nua, Vadhana, Bangkok 10110), where you’ll pay a premium for a friendly environment and staff who are used to international clients.</p> <h3>Staying safe</h3> <p>Compared to many of the world’s capital cities, Bangkok is pretty safe, but petty crime and annoying scams abound. Thieves assume foreigners have money and electronics and target them for bag snatching or pickpocketing. Women aren’t in particular danger, but occasional street harassment and groping still happens.</p> <p>If you hang out on Khaosan Road or around tourist destinations, you’ll undoubtedly be targeted by scammers at least once. They aren’t dangerous and can be easily avoided with a little bit of <a href="http://www.bangkok.com/magazine/5-scams.htm">prior</a> <a href="http://bangkok.usembassy.gov/common_scams.html">research</a>. Away from touristy areas, feel free to stop treating all friendly strangers with suspicion.</p> <p>You’re not likely to accidentally wander into a bad neighborhood, but avoid obviously low-income or touristy areas late at night. Areas attracting lots of foreigners have more crime, so keep your eyes open on Khaosan Road, Silom/Patpong, or Lower Sukhumvit, especially around bars – where, honestly, drunk tourists can be as big a menace as street crime. Drugging is not unheard of, so watch your drinks. If a fight starts between a Thai person and a foreigner, they can get extremely violent fast, often with onlookers piling on, so steer clear.</p> <p>Taxis at night are fairly safe, but keep your wits about you and always take a registered cab. Don’t accept food or drinks from a driver, don’t get into a taxi that already has someone in it, and try to know where you’re going and if the driver takes a wrong turn. It’s best to hail a taxi from the road instead of one that’s been waiting for a long time (unless you are at an official taxi stand, like outside a mall).</p> <p>If you drive a motorcycle, wear a helmet.</p> <h3>Thai customs to keep in mind</h3> <p>Without going too deeply into it, Thai people respect it when you stay polite and composed. In some Western countries, you can win a conflict by raising your voice, &ldquo;calling someone out,&rdquo; and asserting your rights. In Thailand, this just makes you look like a jerk, and everyone around you will be embarrassed by your terrible manners. Smiling, laughing, and staying cool will get you better results.</p> <p>Dressing neatly will also make everything a little easier, as it will gain you some respect by differentiating you from a slovenly tourist.</p> <p>Thai people deeply love their King, which explains why they hang his picture everywhere. Treat these images with respect (no selfies!) and don’t criticize the King or the royal family loudly in public. You won’t face a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A8se_majest%C3%A9">lèse majesté</a> charge, but it’s still really rude. Stop walking and wait quietly when the national anthem plays in public, and stand up for the King’s song before a movie.</p> <p>Double-pricing often enrages foreign visitors to Asia. It’s not as huge a problem in Thailand, but if you ask for a different price, keep it light and respectful, so both of you leave happy. Tourist markets will ask much higher prices at first, but the woman selling bananas on your street is not usually overcharging you (if she is, save yourself the trouble and don’t buy them). Knowing how to count in Thai will avoid most of these problems.</p> <p>Temple grounds will host festivals and markets, and people walk through them in all kinds of clothes. Festivals look like a party, but don’t carry alcohol or smoke cigarettes on the temple grounds. Treat the temple hall itself as you would any church – wear appropriate clothing, don’t talk loudly, and don’t take lots of photos. You’ll rarely get called out on inappropriate behavior by Thai people, but that doesn’t mean no one notices.</p> <p>You’ll remove your shoes before you enter homes and many shops (outside of shopping malls). If you’re not sure, look for a pile of shoes at the door.</p> <p>Not always an issue in Bangkok, but generally speaking, bring toilet paper with you and get used to squat toilets.</p> <h2>Work</h2> <h3>Coworking spaces vouched for by nomads</h3> <p>Thonglor/Ekamai</p> <p>The sociable HUBBA Bangkok (<a href="http://hubbathailand.com/">http://hubbathailand.com/</a> )(19 Soi Ekkamai 4, Sukumvit 63 Rd., Prakanong Nua, Bangkok 10110) is a great place to connect with people and hang out, though it can get a little noisy. (฿260 per day, ฿4,650 per month). The same owners run the nearby PAH Creative Space (<a href="http://www.pahspace.com">www.pahspace.com</a>), which has 3D printers. Membership at either enrolls you in <a href="http://www.coworkingunited.com/">Coworking United</a>, for perks at six other coworking spaces in Thailand and Laos.</p> <p>Set in a purpose-built five-storey building, The Hive, (http:// <a href="http://thehive.co.th/">http://thehive.co.th/</a> )  (Piman 49, 40/9 Soi Sukhumvit 49, Khwaeng Khlong Tan Nuea, Khet Watthana, 10110) has a full café, a social rooftop bar, and two floors of private offices. (฿300 per day, cafe memberships ฿980 per month, and full memberships from ฿5000 per month)</p> <p>The popular Casa Lapin (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CasaLapin"></a>)<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CasaLapin">https://www.facebook.com/CasaLapin</a> coffee shop chain has three locations, Cala Lapin x49 (on Sukhumvit 49), Casa Lapin xAri (at Ari), and Casa Lapin x26 (on Sukhumvit 26).

There’s some legal grey area, but rules against it aren’t likely to be enforced (right now). Thailand’s foreign working restrictions have always been unclear about online work, but that hasn’t stopped the flood of Digital Nomads, so far with few consequences. If you supplement your income with some under-the-table English teaching or other work on the ground, though, you will be working illegally and subject to enforcement.</p> <p>Thailand’s visa rules are notoriously changeable (and we can only update this guide so often), so look for the most updated info before you travel. The forums on <a href="http://www.thaivisa.com">www.ThaiVisa.com</a> have many detailed reports of current regulations - start <a href="http://www.thaivisa.com/forum/forum/1-thai-visas-residency-and-work-permits/">here</a> and dig through the archives for specific questions.</p> <h3>Long term tourist visas</h3> <p>If you&rsquo;re from most of Europe, USA, Australia, New Zealand or 41 other countries, you can enter Thailand by air without a pre-arranged visa. You get a 30-day visa on arrival at the airport, which can be extended for another 7 to 10 days for ~฿2000 at the immigration office, for a total of 37 to 40 days in Thailand.</p> <p>You’re better off pre-arranging a 60-day visa with the Thai embassy in your home country. This 60-day visa can then be extended at the immigration office for another 30 days (also for ~฿2000), giving you a total of 90 days. Ask whether your embassy offers double or triple-entry tourist visas, which can be extended to 90 days, then automatically renew once or twice when you leave Thailand and then re-enter. You have to use all of your entries by the &ldquo;enter before&rdquo; date on your visa so, for example, you can’t leave Thailand for six months, then re-enter on the same visa.</p> <p>The sprawling Chalermprakiat Government Complex (<a href="http://bangkok.immigration.go.th/intro1.html"></a>)<a href="http://bangkok.immigration.go.th/intro1.html">http://bangkok.immigration.go.th/intro1.html</a> (Immigration Division 1 Office, Chalermprakiat Government Complex, Chaengwattana Rd (soi 7), Laksi, Bangkok) handles immigration services in Bangkok. This is outside of the city center and can be accessed by taxi or public transit/taxi, with more detailed directions at <a href="http://live-less-ordinary.com/living-in-bangkok/visa-extension-in-bangkok-immigration-office">http://live-less-ordinary.com/living-in-bangkok/visa-extension-in-bangkok-immigration-office</a>.</p> <p>After your first entry runs out, you can do a visa run getting your passport stamped in another country and returning back to Thailand. Your next entry starts automatically, or if you don’t have a visa, you’ll be stamped in for 15 days or 30 days (if travelling by land) or 30 days (by air). These rules change, though, so always check the most recent reports before you make plans.</p> <p>Visa runs are limited, though, so if Thai authorities see you doing it too often, they might not let you back in. During periods of strict enforcement, you might only be allowed a single visa run by land - though runs by plane are usually far less controlled.</p> <p>Overstaying your visa is a criminal offense and you&rsquo;ll get fined ฿500 for each day. Immigration could give your passport the dreaded red stamp, and there’s a slim chance you won’t be allowed to come back. Flying out instead of crossing a land border gets you a 1-day overstay grace period, with no fines.</p> <h3>Visa runs from Bangkok</h3> <p>If you just need to stamp your passport, the fastest visa run overland from Bangkok is to the Poipet/Aranyapratet border in Cambodia, which you can do in one day. To avoid scams, get a Cambodian <a href="https://www.evisa.gov.kh/">e-visa online</a> at before you go. Ask at a guesthouse or travel agency to join a group, or arrange one online. While it’s possible, arranging an independent trip and return from Poipet/Aranyapratet is not for the faint of heart and could leave you stranded overnight.</p> <p>Consider a cheap international flight from Don Mueang (DMK) Airport through AirAsia for a one-day visa run or a short vacation.</p> <p>If you need to get a new Thai visa, your best options are currently the Thai embassy in Vientiane, Laos, (they will issue a double-entry visa, once or twice) or the consulates in Savannakhet, Laos (double-entry, unlimited) or Bali, Indonesia (triple-entry, unlimited). Remember, though, each case is different and these rules can always change, so Google for current accounts before you make the trip.</p> <h3>How to get a Thai business visa</h3> <p>Most Digital Nomads are going to be totally fine on a Tourist Visa. If you’re working for a Thai company, they’ll help you get a Business Visa (Non-Immigrant &ldquo;B&rdquo; Visa).</p> <p>The many classes of Non-Immigrant &ldquo;B&rdquo; Visas call for sponsorship by a Thai employer, an invitation to do business with a Thai company, or stacks of cash that you plan to invest in Thailand. You process this paperwork with a Thai embassy before you come to Thailand. A Non-Immigrant “B” Visa is not a Work Permit, and you’d need to get that separately, processed by the local immigration office. If you plan to go this route, either get instructions from your Thai employer/partner, or hire an immigration lawyer or visa service.</p> <p>Setting up a <a href="http://siamstartup.com/boi-company-thailand/">BOI (Board of Investment) company</a> is another method to obtain a Business Visa, but unless you know exactly why you need a BOI company, you probably don’t.</p> <h3>Registering your business in Thailand</h3> <p>If you work from your laptop and receive payment internationally, there’s very little reason to legally establish your business in Thailand. You might consider registering your business if you need a permanent physical location, plan to live permanently in Thailand, or want to hire staff legally.</p> <p>The easiest method to set up a Thai company with a foreign owner is using a BOI (Board of Investment) company. This waives many of the intimidating hurdles to setting up a business in Thailand, like majority Thai ownership or the restriction on foreign workers. It is still not easy, though, so talk with a visa company, a lawyer, andor a friend who has been through the process.</p> <h3>Hiring local talent</h3> <p>Since they’re usually in Thailand short-term, it’s not that common for nomads to hire locally. If you do need some help, use personal connections and other nomads to find reliable Thai or foreign contractors. Odesk, Elance and other outsourcing sites are always an option, too.</p> <h2>Play</h2> <h3>Nightlife</h3> <p>Thong Lo offers a huge variety of nightlife. The clubs in Thong Lo serve a mainly Thai clientele, while bars and venues like Seenspace (<a href="http://www.twosave.com/en/shops/seenspace/"></a>)<a href="http://www.twosave.com/en/shops/seenspace/">http://www.twosave.com/en/shops/seenspace/</a> (Thong Lo Soi 13, Bangkok 10110) have a mix of foreigners and Thai clients. Try Game Over (Sukhumvit 55 Khlong Tan Nuea, Watthana, Bangkok 10110) for video games, Daniel Thaiger burgers and craft beers.</p> <p>Or do you need to <a href="http://bk.asia-city.com/city-living/article/bangkok-best-cafe-late-night-free-wifi">work late</a>? </p> <p>Tourists and locals <a href="http://www.10best.com/destinations/thailand/bangkok/nightlife/khao-san-roads-best/">party on Khao San Road</a>, like the ska, reggae and rock bar Brick Bar (<a href="http://www.brickbarkhaosan.com">www.brickbarkhaosan.com</a>) (265 Khaosan Road, Taladyot, Pranakorn Bangkok 10200). Nearby Soi Rambuttri is a nicer, quieter place to drink a bucket.</p> <p>Restaurants, street food, bars, and Bangkok’s most infamous nightlife is around Silom (Sala Daeng BTS).</p> <p>Sathorn Soi 12, near the Surasak Skytrain station, is an up-and-coming area.    </p> <h3>Where to go to relax</h3> <h4>De-stress</h4> <p>You can work out at True Fitness (<a href="http://www.truefitness.co.th/en/facilities/exchange-tower"></a>)<a href="http://www.truefitness.co.th/en/facilities/exchange-tower">http://www.truefitness.co.th/en/facilities/exchange-tower</a> (388 Exchange Tower, LG to 4th Floor, Sukhumvit Road,Klongtoey, Bangkok 10110) or Crossfit Bangkok (<a href="http://www.crossfitbk.com/"></a>)<a href="http://www.crossfitbk.com/">http://www.crossfitbk.com/</a> (2 Sukhumvit Road, Khlong Tan Nuea, Watthana, Bangkok 10110), both near the BTS Asoke station.

Lumpini Park is an option for outdoor jogging or bench-pressing giant hand-welded weights.</p> <p>You have your choice of <a href="http://www.thewellist.com/2013/11/yoga-bikram-ashtanga-bangkok/">yoga studios</a> convenient to the Skytrain, with classes between ฿500-700. Iyengar Yoga Studio (<a href="http://www.iyengar-yoga-bangkok.com/">http://www.iyengar-yoga-bangkok.com/</a>)  (3rd Floor Fiftyfifth Plaza Building, 90 Sukhumvit Soi 55, Bangkok 10110) is right on Thong Lor.</p> <p>Bangkok’s best hotels have opulent, <a href="http://www.bangkok.com/magazine/10-best-pool-hotels.htm">fashionable swimming pools</a> and facilities, with varying rates for use by non-guests.
