There&rsquo;s a lot of areas in Chiang Mai that would appeal to different kind of people. Same thing with apartments / guest houses / hostels. </p> <p>So, to know where you&rsquo;re going at first, simply rent a guest house / hostel / hotel / air&#39;bnb place online for 2-3 nights in an <a href="#areas">area</a> you think you will like and walk around to find a place for longer term. To rent something online, often the cheapest options are on <a href="https://www.agoda.com">agoda</a> or <a href="https://www.hotelquickly.com">hotelquickly.com</a>. Keep in mind that Airbnb is generally more expensive than any other options. And booking online is generally more expensive than &lsquo;walk-in prices&rsquo;.</p> <p>Useful links to find a place for long term stay (1 month or more):</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://blog.chrisgrabinski.com/2015/04/26/monthly-apartment-rentals-in-chiang-mai/">Chiang Mai Apartments under THB10000 for Digital Nomads</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.chiangmaibuddy.com/accommodation-chiang-mai/">Chiang Mai Buddy - Cheap Hotels: Weekly or Monthly Apartment Accommodation in Chiang Mai Thailand</a></li> </ul> <p>Some other tips:</p> <ul> <li>When you walk around and visit serviced apartments/guest houses/hostels you can ask to see the room before. </li> <li>You can ask for discounts if you stay longer. It probably won&rsquo;t work in places where they alreay have monthly prices (like serviced apartments), but it&rsquo;s worth a try in guest houses.</li> </ul> <h3>Songkran and Other Holidays</h3> <p>It would be wise to rent something before getting in Chiang Mai you plan on arriving during Songkran (Thailand&rsquo;s new year). It lasts 3 days officially in Thailand, but in Chiang Mai the festivities are lasting more like 5 days, and during these days the price of accomodations are obviously more expensive (sometimes double). </p> <p>During high season (November to beginning of February) it can be bit more difficult to find something at the last minute, but definitely not impossible.</p> <h2><a name=areas></a> Areas</h2> <h3>Nimman</h3> <p>Often described as the &#39;hipster&rsquo; area, this area (mostly on or around Nimman street) has a lot of cafes where you can work from. There&rsquo;s also restaurants with good western food and, of course, a lot of thai food places with different price range.</p> <p>A lot of digital nomads like to stay there because there&rsquo;s a lot of different places where you can comfortably work from (big cafes and coworking spaces) with decent wifis.</p> <h3>The Old City</h3> <p>The old city is the &#39;square&rsquo; area (if you look at a map), surrounded by a moat (small river). Backpackers often go there, mostly in the north east. This place has a lot of guest houses and restaurants.</p> <h3>Around the Night Market</h3> <p>This area is where the &#39;traditional&rsquo; tourists are staying.</p> <h2>Getting Around</h2> <ul> <li>You can get around in Songthaews (red trucks). You stop them when you see one, tell them where you&rsquo;re going. If they can go there, they will bring you. ** Most of the drivers know the landmarks (gates at the old city, big shopping malls, temples, markets). However, trying to show them a map (paper or on your phone) can be a challenge because most of them aren&rsquo;t used to reading/using maps. ** When you stop one, just tell them where you&rsquo;re going. If they agree, don&rsquo;t wait there for a price nor ask for one, go right at the back of the truck. The fix price is 20 bahts. When you arrive, get out, and pay the driver. ** For longer distances, the driver will tell you the price if it&rsquo;s different than 20 bahts. Sometimes it&rsquo;s somewhat random, so you can try to negotiate or simply don&rsquo;t get in if you think it&rsquo;s too expensive.</li> <li>You can rent a scooter in Chiang Mai to get around that huge area. If you want to go to places like in the mountains, waterfalls or simply explore, it&rsquo;s probably the best option. ** Check with your insurances / what you can drive legally with your driver&rsquo;s license at home. It&rsquo;s possible that you won&rsquo;t be covered in case of an accident. ** It&rsquo;s illegal not to wear a helmet. If you drive without one, you can get arrested and you&rsquo;ll need to pay a fine. ** After 3 months in Thailand, you have to have a Thai drivers license. Again, if you don&rsquo;t have one, you can get arrested and will have to pay a fine. ** It&rsquo;s helpful to have an international driving licence when driving in Thailand, otherwise you could be fined.</li> <li>Tuk-tuks are usually more expensive than other alternatives. </li> <li>Taxis are less common than say in Bangkok. You usually have to phone one if you need a pickup. You can also ask at your accommodation if you need one.</li> </ul> <h2>Wifi and Internet Access</h2> <p>It&rsquo;s hard to predict how the wifi is going to act in specific places. Sometimes you can go to an apartment and it&rsquo;s lightning fast. Then, 3 days later, it doesn&rsquo;t work at all. Same with coffee places. Generally speaking, in serviced apartments they&rsquo;re better (with more wifi points), but they can get crowded too.</p> <p>Alternatives in case the wifi you use doesn&rsquo;t work well:</p> <ul> <li>Get a sim with a data plan or wifi access (providing you&rsquo;re near a wifi spot)</li> <li>Having your own modem installed in your place (ask before you rent, it&rsquo;s not always possible). It&rsquo;s generally way faster and more predictable, but keep in mind that it&rsquo;s also possible to have an outage of a couple of minutes (can be as long as 1 hour). It doesn&rsquo;t happen often, but it&rsquo;s possible.</li> <li>Go to a coworking place</li> <li>Go to another coffee place. There&rsquo;s a lot of them, there&rsquo;s always a good wifi connection somewhere!</li> </ul> <h2>Sims &amp; Data Plans</h2> <p>There&rsquo;s a couple of different data plans and companies out there, and their website aren&rsquo;t always easy to understand. Here&rsquo;s a couple of tips/info:</p> <ul> <li>If you&rsquo;re staying in the Nimman area, AIS has a fast wifi point in Maya Mall where you can work from 24 hours (in &#39;Camp&rsquo;)</li> <li>If your phone is unlocked you won&rsquo;t have any problem getting a sim.</li> <li>There&rsquo;s a lot of monthly plans or &#39;pay as you go&rsquo; plan without any need to get a contract.</li> <li>You can get 6 gig (sometimes 12 gig) for around 30 USD per month. And it&rsquo;s usually fast and reliable. </li> <li>Chiang Mai now has 4G speed.</li> <li>AIS have normally a better coverage over Chiang Mai. DTAC has good plans too.</li> <li>To buy a sim, you&rsquo;ll need to show your passport. </li> <li>You can buy a sim card in most of the malls. </li> <li>You can &#39;recharge&rsquo; your sim card online or at 7 eleven.</li> <li>Unlimited plans are usually not that &#39;unlimited&rsquo;. They usually have a data cap and gets slower after that. You can use your emails with these, but using your connection with your laptop will be really slow. So, if you see a 2gig at 4g Unlimited plan, it usually means you have 2 gig with a &#39;4g speed&rsquo;, but then the speed will decrease after you reach that 2 gig cap of download.</li> </ul> <h2>Visas / Visa Extensions / Visa Run</h2> <ul> <li>There&rsquo;s a &#39;30 days free entry&rsquo; in Thailand. Just check the requirements VS your citizenship.</li> <li>You can usually get a tourist visas (depending on your citizenship) with multiple entries. Each entry is good for 2 months, which you can extend for 1 more month. You can get 1, 2 or 3 entries visa. So the longest you can get with a visa would be 3 entries (of 2 months each) and extend them of one more month each time. Which would be a total of 9 months.</li> <li>It gets more and more difficult to get in and out all the time without visas (on 30 days free entries). If you do that, it&rsquo;s preferable if you spend a couple of days (like a week) in other countries before coming back to Thailand.</li> <li>If you&rsquo;re already in Thailand and want a visa, you need to get out in another country. <a href="http://live-less-ordinary.com/cheapest-thai-visa-runs-from-bangkok/">Here&rsquo;s an article with a couple of other countries where you can go to get a visa for Thailand</a></li> <li>If your visa or &#39;30 days free entry&rsquo; is ending, you can usually extend it for 30 more days (check the visa requirements for your country). Here&rsquo;s an article to help you with that: <a href="http://www.thewayofslowtravel.com/2014/02/08/how-to-extend-your-thai-tourist-visa-in-chiang-mai/">Extend Your Thai Tourist Visa in Chiang Mai</a></li> </ul> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.min.js"></script><script src="../../../assets/javascripts/application.js"></script> <script>
